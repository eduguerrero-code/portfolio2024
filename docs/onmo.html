      <p style="font-size: 1rem; font-weight: 200;">Onmo was born to give customers the tools and education they need to have a healthy relationship with money. In a saturated market where the offer is the same betweeen the competitors, the only differential element is the App User Experience. Onmo was born as a money buddy for the users, and therefore the app should reflect that attitude.

A system of 3 layers was created to have support accessible from every screen in the app, so the user could “feel” that support at any stage of any process they could be involved in the App. </p>
